Hi, my name is Benjamin. I am 16 years old and live in Slovenia.
My favourite subject in school is math and I code in my free time.
My favourite thing to do in programming are coding competitions and I am slowly getting better and better at them.
I'm currently relearning Python and will soon start learning CSS and Javascript.
I've also learnt how to code in C# a few years ago, but I have forgotten it at this point.
I am eager to start collaborating on projects, but my lack of coding skills is the only thing that is keeping me down at the moment.
Should you have any questions about me, you can contact me on my email: benjamin.rajer@gmail.com
