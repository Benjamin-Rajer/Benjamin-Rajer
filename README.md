Hi, my name is Benjamin. I am 15 years old and live in Slovenia.
My favourite subject in school is math and I code in my free time.
My favourite thing to do in programming are coding competitions and I am slowly getting better and better at them.
I'm currently relearning Python and will soon start learning CSS and Javascript.
I've also learnt how to code in C# a few years ago, but I have forgotten it at this point.
I will eventually start collaborating on projects with others, but my coding skills are still not that good.
Should you have any questions about me, you can contact me on my email: benjamin.rajer@gmail.com
